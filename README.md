## This app represents three works 💻 :  
🚀 Ariane: When the three buttons are On, then the text displayed will be GO, otherwise NO WAY, this exercise allowed me to understand the state well.  
🎬 Netflix: A front-end replication which allowed me to practice the map method and json file.  
👨‍💻 Job board: A board listing 9 different jobs in the developer world, also representing my first steps in React.  

## I just learned:  
🖇 Link tags, showing the active page with clsx.  
🔧 Images tags.  
✨ How to handle a global CSS.  
🎆 How to use Tailwind which is very good for responsive.  

## This project is also done with Typescript.
